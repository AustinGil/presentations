# Building Superpowered Forms With JavaScript 

---

# Let's define 'powers'

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 text-left">
<v-clicks>
<div>

## Baseline
- Semantic (conveys meaning)
- Accessible (works with AT)
- Fast (nothing **unnecessary**)
- Secure (?)
- Browser built-in features
</div>
<div>

## Superpowers
- Improve existing features (a11y)
- Add nonexistant features (UX)
- Don't break the baseline
</div>
</v-clicks>
</div>

---

# A very basic example

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">

```html
<div>Do the thing</div>
```

Make this div clickable

<v-clicks>

- `onclick="handleClick()"`
- `onkeydown="handleKeydown()"`
- `tabindex="0"`
- `role="button"`
</v-clicks>
<v-click>

- Lot's of work
- Missing features
<br>(eg. open in new tab)
- Relies on JavaScript
</v-click>

</div>

<img src="/img/forms/ally-mimic.jpg" class="block m-auto -mt-8" width="480" alt="button html element looking at a div element and saying to anchor element, 'Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power'">

# Good rule of thumb

<v-clicks>

1. HTML is awesome. Use it as much as possible.
2. If it can't be done with HTML, use CSS
3. If it can't be done with CSS, use JavaScript

<div class="grid grid-cols-2">
<div>

* Has the page loaded yet?
* Did the connection drop?
* Did the connection time out?
* Is there a corporate firewall?
* Did the ISP interfere?
* Is the client a microbrowser?
* Is JavaScript turned off?
* Is Data Saver mode on?
</div>
<div>

* Did extensions alter the DOM?
* Did Adblockers interfere?
* Is the CDN up?
* Does their browser support the JavaScript you‚Äôve written?
* Did a library change?
* Did a library author bug?
* Did you add a bug?

# Inputs

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<v-clicks>
<div>

Cool things we can improve:

- Multiselect
- File drop-zone
- Awesome date pickers
- Type-ahead/autosuggest

</div>
<div>

Easy things we can break:

- Actual functionality
- Accessible controls
- Keyboard navigation
- Works with or without JS

</div>
</v-clicks>
</div>

---

# Validation

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<v-clicks>
<div>

Cool things we can improve:

- Custom error messages
- Better looking UI
- More immediate feedback (`onblur`, `onchange`, `oninput`)
- Accessibility improvements (`aria-invalid`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-describedby`)

</div>
<div>

Easy things we can break:

- Communicate errors to AT
- Scroll to first invalid input on submit
- Trample existing ARIA attributes
- Works with or without JS

</div>
</v-clicks>
</div>

# Submissions

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<v-clicks>
<div>

Cool things we can improve:

- Autosave (submit)
- Keyboard shortcuts (`ctrl+enter`)
- Avoid page load (`fetch`)

</div>
<div>

Important things we mustn't break:

- Prevent spamming submit
- Using correct `Content-Type`
- Respects server redirects
- Handle server errors
- Existing keyboard shortcuts
- Works with or without JS

</div>

- Inputs don't need state management.
- Data doesn't need to be sent as JSON.
- You don't need custom fetch requests for every endpoint.
- You don't need fancy validation libraries.
- You don't need fancy HTTP libraries.
</v-clicks>
<!-- - Don't use JS unless it improves UX enough to offset it's cost while maintaining feature-parity. -->
<!-- - Stop breaking existing functionality
- And stop preventing copy/paste -->

# Instead

<v-clicks>

Use the powers HTML+CSS already have

Let forms provide declarative submission logic

Let inputs provide declarative  validation logic

Add a little JavaScript to enhance existing features (without breaking)

Use the same JavaScript abstraction across multiple forms

Relax because it's practically bulletproof

# JavaScript-ONLY superpowers

<v-clicks>

- Input masks
- Repeater fields
- Re-ordering (drag and drop)
- Client-side file manipulation
- Detect if input has been touched (soon `:user-invalid`)
- Dynamic validation (eg. password matching)
- Prevent data loss from navigation
- Support for retries
- Offline support and resumability
