# Why you should care

Accessibility has a lot of positive benefits

<v-clicks>

- More users = more conversions
- Better code = happy robots (SEO)
- Legal compliance = fewer lawsuits
- Ethical (subjective) = I feel better

</v-clicks>

# But a11y is HARD

<v-clicks>

It's hard to learn

It's hard to remember

It's hard to implement

It's hard to test

Run a11y analysis from your deployment pipeline, automatically.

Playwright ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/)) & Cypress ([cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/)) are amazing

- Run tests in real browsers (not synthetic)
- Deque aXe plugins: [`@axe-core/playwright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/playwright) & [`cypress-axe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-axe)
- Test entire pages or just components
- Integrate into CI/CD
- Prevent pushing a11y issues to prod

# Caveats

<v-clicks>

- We're only catching things robots can test.
- Accessibility isn't about numbers, it's about experience.
- Tooling and automation doesn't replace real user testing.
- Analytics can tell you details about YOUR users.
- 100% WCAG score doesn't always mean accessible. <br>
(see ‚Äú[Building the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect Lighthouse score](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/)‚Äù by [Manuel Matuzovic](https://twitter.com/mmatuzo))

# Final thoughts

---

Make it easy to do right and hard to do wrong.

<v-clicks>

Not everyone needs to be an expert (üå∂).

Robots multiply your impact (ü§ñ = üë®‚Äçüíªx100).

But robots don't replace humans.

They unlock time/brainpower to focus on bigger things.

100% lighthouse scores is the start line, not the finish line.
