During HTTP requests, each chunk triggers the `request.on()` method.

# Saving Files to<br>Object Storage

---

# What is Object Storage?

A single, central place to store and access all of your uploads.

<v-clicks>

Highly available, easily scalable, and often 10x cheaper than server space.

Ideally should be S3-compatible.
</v-clicks>

---

# What is S3?

S3 ("Simple Storage Service") is AWS's object storage product.

<v-clicks>

Has become a standard communication protocol for Object Storage solutions.

Libraries: `@aws-sdk/client-s3 @aws-sdk/lib-storage`
</v-clicks>

---

# Getting files to Object Storage

1. Signed URLs
2. Stream through proxy

---

# Signed URLs

<v-clicks>

- Frontend request asks for a signed URL.
- Backend gets it from Object Storage provider.
- Backend gives signed URL to the frontend.
- Frontend uploads directly to provider.
</v-clicks>

# Getting into the weeds

<v-clicks>

- formidable wants to write chunks to a stream.
- S3 upload wants to read chunks from a stream.
- We need to store the file's location somewhere.
- We need to track pending upload requests.

# Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

Globally distributed network of servers that caches content close to users.

<v-clicks>

Initial requests pass through CDN node, pull content from origin server, and cache it. Subsequent requests get cached content.

Faster deliver of static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, etc.)

# [OWASP.org File Upload Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Upload_Cheat_Sheet.html)

- Extension Validation
- Filename Sanitization
- Upload and Download Limits
- File Storage Location
- Content-Type Validation
- File Content Validation
- Malware Scanning Architecture
- Block Malware at the Edge

---

# Filename Sanitization

Prevent long file names or dangerous characters for OS.  

<v-click>

```js
const form = formidable({
  // other config options
  filename(file) {
    // return some random string
  },
});
```

(formidable does this by default)
</v-click>

---

# Upload and Download Limits

Reasonable file size limits can avoid storage and bandwidth issues/costs.

<v-click>

```js
const form = formidable({
  // other config options
  maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 10, // 10mb
});
```

(formidable defaults to 200mb max file size)
</v-click>
---

# File Storage Location

Quarantine files away from running application and with limited permissions.

<v-click>

```js
const form = formidable({
  // other config options
  uploadDir: './uploads',
});
```

(formidable defaults to OS's temp folder)
</v-click>

---

# Extension Validation **

Only allow files with allowed extensions into your system.

<v-click>

```js
const form = formidable({
  // other config options
  filter(file) {
    const allowed = /\.(jpe?g|png|gif|avif|webp|svg)$/i;
    return allowed.test(file.originalFilename)
  }
});
```
</v-click>

---

# Content-Type Validation **

Only allow files with allowed [MIME-types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) into your system.

<v-click>

```js
const form = formidable({
  // other config options
  filter(file) {
    const mimetype = file.mimetype ?? '';
    return Boolean(mimetype.includes('image'));
  }
});
```

(formidable bases `file.mimetype` from file extension)
</v-click>

---

# File Content Validation **

Scanning files for malware is one of the more important security steps you can take when accepting file uploads.

<v-clicks>

- The file must already be on our server to scan.
- Scans take too long for the reqquest/response cycle.
- This requires a whole new architecture.
</v-clicks>

---

# Malware Scanning Architecture

<v-clicks>

1. Store files in quatantine
2. Save file metadata and scan status in DB
3. Respond to user with upload pending info
4. Allow users to view file metadata
5. Background process scans pending files
6. Clean files get updated in DB
7. Decided on strategy for dirty files
