<!-- Hello friends!

This is Austin Gil, and I'm very excited to have you all at my workshop tomorrow, "Make Accessibility Easier to get Right & Harder to get Wrong"

I wanted to reach out with a few things you can do now to help things run more smoothly tomorrow.

You'll want to make sure you have Git (https://git-scm.com/) and Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine, as well as a code editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a GitHub account (https://github.com/)

There is a repository we'll be working from (https://github.com/AustinGil/accessiblitz), so if you want to clone that and install the NPM dependencies from inside the /react folder, it could help speed things up. Here's the command to do all that from a unix terminal:

git clone https://github.com/AustinGil/accessiblitz.git && cd accessiblitz/react && npm install

We will be learning how to setup automated tests with Cypress and/or Playwright. You can choose just one or both, but there are some other terminal commands to set those up.

For Cypress users: npx cypress verify
For Playwright users: npx playwright install --with-deps

If a background color is <span style="color:#000;background:#BADA55;">&nbsp;#bada55&nbsp;</span>

And WCAG AA requires color contrast ratio of 4.5:1

What color should the foreground text be...?
