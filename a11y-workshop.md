Introduction
- To get more people on board, you have to make it easy to do the right thing, and hard to do the wrong thing. The problem with a lot of current UI libraries is they follow that principle, but require library specific knowledge. Which is just as hard to learn as ARIA. So you have to master a different skill that isn't even transferable.

Development tools

Compare different types of website & semantic layout

Create components
- Layouts (skip links)
- Element with text/heading (not knowing document order)
- SVG (built in labels make it easy)
- Image (enforce alt text)
- How do you prevent invalid HTML? (eg. Buttons containing divs)
- Input (fallback ID)
- Card list (:focus-within + expando-link)
- Dialog

Styling
- Styling with semantics/aria: button[aria-expanded="true"] {}
- visually-hidden class
- focus-within
- reduced-motion
- @supports
- color-themes 
- Grid/flex ordering
- Semantic headings vs size
