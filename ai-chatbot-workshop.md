<!-- Hello friends!

This is Austin Gil, and I'm very excited to have you all at my workshop.

In order for things to run smoothly, I'd like you all to set some things up ahead of time.

- Install Git (https://git-scm.com/)
- Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install a code editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
- Create an account at OpenAI (https://openai.com/)
- Make sure your OpenAI account has credits
- 

There is a repository we'll be working from (https://github.com/AustinGil/accessiblitz), so if you want to clone that and install the NPM dependencies from inside the /react folder, it could help speed things up. Here's the command to do all that from a unix terminal:

git clone https://github.com/AustinGil/accessiblitz.git && cd accessiblitz/react && npm install

We will be learning how to setup automated tests with Cypress and/or Playwright. You can choose just one or both, but there are some other terminal commands to set those up.

For Cypress users: npx cypress verify
For Playwright users: npx playwright install --with-deps
