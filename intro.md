# 🚧 DISCLOSURE 🚧

I work at <a href="https://akamai.com">Akamai (akamai.com)</a>

We offer a lot of relevant services

It's really hard not to mention (kind of my job)

Impossible to be 100% unbiased

# 🤝 ASSURANCE 😘

This is not a sales pitch in disguise

I'm here to teach practical & generic concepts

I may mention Akamai because it's what I'm close to

But this info applies anywhere
