# Type checking a file

`npm init -y`

```js
// @ts-check
```

---

# Type checking your project

```json
"javascript.implicitProjectConfig.checkJs": true
```

---

# Type checking some team's project

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "checkJs": true,
  }
}
```

---

# Creating complex types

```js
/**
 * @typedef {object} Dog
 * @property {string} breed
 * @property {number} age
 * @property {string?} name
 */
```

---

# Type checking whole team's project

`npm install --save-dev typescript`

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "checkJs": true,

{
  "scripts": {

# Integrating CI/CD

# Adding types to libraries

# Why I love

- As a developer - copy/paste my code anywhere
- As a writer - people can easily use my code
- As a teacher - simpler setup and less to learn
- As an OS maintainer - quicker sandbox reproductions
- As a team lead - strong types without the learning overhead for new devs
- As a debugger - fewer issues with source maps
- As a reviewer - no mixing code and types (subjective)

---

# What I don't love

Type Assertions in TS: ðŸ™‚

```ts
const canvas1 = 
  document.querySelector("canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;
const canvas2 =
  <HTMLCanvasElement>document.querySelector("canvas");
```

<v-click>

Type Assertions in JSDocs: ðŸ¤®

```ts
const canvas1 = /** @type {HTMLCanvasElement} */ (
  document.querySelector("canvas")
);
```
</v-click>

# Closing

- Type checking != TypeScript
<v-clicks>

- It's not one or the other
- JSDocs is good BECAUSE TypeScript exists
- We still use `.d.ts` files and the CLI
- It's mostly just syntactical difference in authoring
- For me, verbose comments + terse code is better than verbose code
- TS is an important testing ground for JS proposals & paves cow paths

</v-clicks>

# Community Support for JSDocs

"My position is, types are fantastic, TypeScript is a bit of a pain â€¦ as soon as you use a .ts file, then you have to have the tooling to support that â€¦ thereâ€™s all of these points of friction when you use a non-standard language like TypeScript that I have come to believe makes it not worth it." - [Rich Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJHO6FSioPI)

"Like to keep the source I author the same as the source at runtime because debugging is way faster when it isn't a murder mystery." - [@brianleroux](https://twitter.com/brianleroux/status/1684571157188706304)

"verbose comment - terse code" - [@myfonj](https://twitter.com/myfonj/status/1501956653981175810)
